QuickOSM allows you to work quickly with OSM datas in QGIS thanks to Overpass API.
* Write some queries for you by providing a key/value
* Choose to run the query on an area or an extent
* Configure the query : which layers, which columns ...
* Save your queries in categories and run them later
* Open a local OSM (.osm or .pbf) with a specific osmconf in QGIS
