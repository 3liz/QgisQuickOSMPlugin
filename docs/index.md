QuickOSM is a QGIS plugin to download data from Overpass server.

QuickOSM allows you to work quickly with OSM data in QGIS thanks to [Overpass API][Overpass].

* Write some queries for you by providing a key/value
* Choose to run the query on an area or an extent
* Configure the query : which layers, which columnsâ€¦
* Open a local OSM (.osm or .pbf) with a specific osmconf in QGIS
* Build some models with QGIS Processing

There are some useful tips, like automatic colours on lines (if the tag is present),
or some actions (right-click in the attribute table) for each entity (edit in JOSM for instance).
