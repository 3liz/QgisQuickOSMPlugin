<h3 id="generalities">Generalities</h3>
<p>
The plugin will keep all columns available in OSM's datas.
</p>
<p>
If no styling file is defined, QuickOSM will check if a "colour" field is present in a line vector layer. This is usefull for route=bus/tram.
</p>
<p>
Some actions are enabled by default. You can edit, open with JOSM each entities. Some actions may be added if some fields are presents :
<ul>
	<li>url, website</li>
	<li>wikipedia</li>
	<li>ref:UAI for French's schools</li>
	<li>network and ref will open the sketchline from Overpass</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3 id="my-queries">My queries</h3>
<p>"My queries" shows you all predefined queries.</p>
<p>A query is composed of two files.
<ul>
	<li>.ini with all metadata</li>
	<li>.xml or .oql with the query in XML or OQL</li>
</ul>
So as to add your queries, you have to go to "Query" where you can save your query.
A ini file is composed with many blocks :
<ul>
	<li>metadata
		<ul>
			<li>name : compulsory</li>
			<li>category : compulsory</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>points|lines|multilinestrings|multipolygons : each blocks about these layers are compulsory.
		<ul>
			<li>load : compulsory, boolean True or False. If this layer should be load.</li>
			<li>nameLayer : optional, string with the name of the layer</li>
			<li>columns : optional, list of columns seperated by a comma. If empty, all columns will be keep</li>
			<li>style : optional, name of the QML style to apply</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3 id="quick-query">Quick query</h3>
<p>Quickquery allows you to query on one key=value. You can choose between the extent of the map canvas or in a city. The city is searched by Nominatim, you can avoid strange result by writting the relation OSM's ID.</p>
<p>You can choose which OSM objects :
<ul>
	<li>Node</li>
	<li>Way</li>
	<li>Relation</li>
</ul>
You can choose which geometries you want at the end :
<ul>
	<li>Points</li>
	<li>Lines</li>
	<li>Multilinestrings</li>
	<li>Multipolygons</li>
</ul>
If you want to specify which columns you want, you can click on "Show query".
</p>
<h3 id="query">Query</h3>
<p>This panel allows you to write your own query manually (in XML or OQL).</p>
<p>For each layers provided by OGR, you can specify the outputs you want and which fields you want to get.</p>
<p>From this panel, you can save your query. The outputs and each whitelists will be save.
<ul>
	<li>as template : this will save the query which is written above. The query won't be change. If you want to change the city, change it in the XML.</li>
	<li>as finale query : the query will be generated before. This is usefull if you don't want to save {{bbox}} but the actual extent.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3 id="osm-file">OSM file</h3>
<p>OGR can open a OSM file with the help of a special file configuration called osmconf. This file is used to describe each key you want for a column. You can specify these fields for each layer.
<p>You can copy/paste the default osmconf.ini so as to modify it.</p>
<p>For more informations about OSM in OGR, <a href="http://www.gdal.org/drv_osm.html">read the documentation</a></p>

<h3 id="processing">Processing</h3>
<p>QuickOSM brings a lot of new processing algorithms. You should have a look to these algos. Some models are available in the models's folder of the plugin.</p>
<p>Let your imagination take off with processing !</p>
